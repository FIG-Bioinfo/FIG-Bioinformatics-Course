## Update Course Material

In order to update the course material to the most recent version, follow the instructions below. 

1. First open up VS Code and open the directory with the course in it. 
2. Next open up a terminal in VSCode. 
3. Inside the terminal, use the following command. Be sure to put in your own name inside the command instead of FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME. 
 ``` git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"```
4. Inside the terminal, use the following command. Be sure to put in your own name inside the command instead of MY_NAME@example.com.  
```git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"```
5. Inside the terminal, use the command 'git pull'. 

** Note: Steps 3 and 4 are only necessary on the first update. All following updates can skip straight to step 5.
