## Course Syllabus

### 1. Representative Genomes

1. Tab Separated Files - Programming Basics and how to read Tab Separated Value Files
2. FASTA files - Basic Bioinformatic operations on a "common denominator" format used to store and share genomic sequence data
3. Kmers and Jaccard Similarities - How Bioinformatic Scientists measure the similarity between two sequences

### 2. Hammers

1. Hammers - A type of "Genetic Barcode"
2. Creation of the Hammer Set - Create your own set of hammers based on a single role
3. Hammer Worthiness - Determine which Role and how many of them are needed for a quality hammer set
4. Using Hammers - Classify the genomes that are present inside of a sample

### 3. Projections

1. Sample Set Creation - Create the sample report needed to feed the hammer output into an "X-matrix"
2. X-Matrix Battleship - Create the X-matrix necessary to feed into a classifier
3. Creating a Classifier - Create the ancilary data to make a classifier and explore the inner workings of what happens at each stage.
4. Tuning the Classifier - Validation data ensures that the classifier should work well on real-world data. Find out what quality testing you can do to make the system more accurate.
