Please write a python script that accepts a base path and
target directory as arguments, then reads a list of SRA-IDs from STDIN,
and iterates over the IDs executing the following pair of commands
to fetch data from a remote repository:
"""
p3-cp ws:{base_path}/.{sra_id}/{sra_id}_1_ptrim.fq.gz {target_dir}
"""
and
"""
p3-cp ws:{base_path}/.{sra_id}/{sra_id}_2_ptrim.fq.gz {target_dir}
"""

The program should print a progress-message to STDERR
indicating the SRA-ID that it is currently fetching,
and should handle failed attempts gracefully while printing
a warning to STDERR.
