Please write a program named `hammer_compare_advanced.py` that will:

* Accept a mandatory TSV "hammers" filename argument,
short name `-H`, long name `--hammers`.

* Accept a mandatory TSV genome-names filename argument,
short name `-G`, long name `--genome-names`.

* Accept an optional "minimum fraction of roles required" argument,
short name `-F`, long name `--role-fraction`, default-value 0.8.

* Open the hammer-file and perform the following:
    
    - Read the header-line and extract the column-names
    
    - Foreach subsequent line, read the "hammer" and "fid"
    columns as `hammer` and `feature_id` variables,
    respectively, and built a dictionary mapping
    hammers to feature_ids.

    - If a "role" column exists, read it as the `role` variable,
    else the role should default to "Unknown",
    and build a dictionary mapping feature_ids to roles.

    - A `feature_id` has the format 'fig|x.y.peg.z',
    where 'x', 'y', and 'z' are integers, and 'fig|' and '.peg.'
    are literal substrings; the portion 'x.y' is the `genome_id`
    for that 'feature_id'. Extract the `genome_id` from the `feature_id`
    using a regex, and build a dictionary mapping feature_id to its genome_id.

    - Determine the Kmer-length `K` of the hammers.
    (NOTE: all the hammers in the file will have the same length.)

    - Return the hammer-length `K`, the list of roles,
    the hammer-to-feature_id dictionary,
    the feature_id-to-genome_id dictionary,
    and the feature_id-to-role dictionary

* Open the 'genome-names' file, skip the header-line,
and for subsequent lines read the first and second columns
into a dictionary as a `genome_id` and `genome_name`, respectively;
then return the genome_id-to-genome_names dictionary.

* Create an empty directory whose keys will be genome-IDs,
and values will be an integer count of the number of hammers
found for that genome.

* Create an empty "dictionary of dictionaries" whose outer-keys will be genome_ids,
inner-keys will be roles, and inner-values will be the integer count
for the number of hammers found for that role in that genome.

* Use BioPython to read the sequences of the genome from `STDIN`;
the sequence should then be converted to lower-case.

* For each sequence, extract all possible Kmers, and if a Kmer
is a hammer, increment the hammer-count for its associated `genome_id`
in the genome-counts dictionary, and also the hammer-count for that role
in the genome-to-role-to-counts directory-of-directories;
then repeat this operation on the reverse-complement of that sequence,
since a gene can face in either direction.

* Once all the sequences have been processed,
foreach genome_id in the genome-to-roles-to-counts directory
of directories, if the number of roles for that genome
is greater than or equal to the total number of roles
times the minimum fraction of roles,
print to STDOUT a TSV file of the genome_ids found
and their associated genome_name and score,
sorted by decreasing genome-to-counts score.
If the total number of roles exceeds 1,
also add a column for the number of roles for the genome.
Please handle missing genome-names gracefully;
if a genome_id does not have an associated genome-name,
display the genome_name as 'Unknown sp.' in the output TSV file,
and send a warning to STDERR that the name of genome_id was not in
the genome-names file.
