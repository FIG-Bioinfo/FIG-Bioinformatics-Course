I have two sets of genomes derived from metagenomic samples.
Half of the samples are from disease patients,
and the other half are from control subjects.

Foreach sample, each genome is associated with a score,
but the scores are not normalized, so they cannot be compared
between samples, only within samples. We do not know what threshold
separates "significant" scores from "noise" scores.
The threshold may well depend on the size of the sample,
and may therefore differ from sample to sample.

There are many more genomes in the list from in each sample
than there are samples. 

Given the above description of our data, what method would you recommend
that we use to construct a classifier that would estimate whether
a new sample is more likely to be from a disease patient
than from a control subject?
