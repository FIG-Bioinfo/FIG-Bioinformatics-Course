Assuming that the SRA toolkit is installed in the user's path,
please write a Python script named 'sra_download.py'
that takes the following mandatory named inputs:

* -i or --id-file --- Name of a file containing a list of SRA-IDs in its first column.

* -d or --download-directory --- name of an output directory to write processed data-files to.

In addition, the script should support the following optional argument:

* -c or --sra-cache --- name of an optional cache-directory to be used by SRA commands such as 'prefetch'.

Foreach SRA-ID, the script should print a message to STDERR
indicating that it is fetching that SRA-ID,
then use the SRA-toolkit's 'prefetch' command to fetch the FASTQ
or FASTA file associated with that SRA-ID,
and finally print a message to STDERR indicating
the size of the downloaded file, whether it was FASTQ or FASTA,
and whether it was single-ended or paired-end if the download
was successful, else print a warning-message if the download failed.

Next, if the download was successful, and if the SRA-entry
is a set of paired-end reads, the script should used SRA-tools
to split the FASTQ file into left and right reads.

Finally, the script should print to STDERR the number of SRA-entries
requested, the number of entries where the download succeeded,
and the numbers of single-ended and paired-end entries downloaded.
