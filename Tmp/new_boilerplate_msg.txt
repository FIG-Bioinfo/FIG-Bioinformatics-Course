Launch VScode, and open the course-folder
if VScode has not already done so automatically.
Then got to the terminal-window if it is open,
else launch a new terminal.
You should see a message indicating that `COURSE_HOME`
has been set to the course-folder, and that the
`cdcourse` command will always bring you back
to the course home.
