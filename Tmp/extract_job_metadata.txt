Please write a python script that:

* Accepts a directory-name as a mandatory argument;

* Tests the directory to see if it exists;

* Reads the regular filenames in the directory, skipping "dotfiles";

* Foreach file,
    - Read the file as a JSON object containing a list
        of key-value-pair dictionaries;
    - Foreach dictionary, extract the fields 'accession', 'run_id',
        'platform_name', 'library_strategy', 'library_layout', 'size',
        and prints the extracted fields to STDOUT as a
        tab-separated-value file with header-line.
