#### FASTA Exercise 1 - What is FASTA Format?

Objective: Become familiar with the FASTA file-format. 

FASTA is one of the most basic file-formats for storage and exchange of biological sequences. We use them constantly when looking at data in the bioinformatics space. In order to use them, we first need to understand how they came to be and what information is available in them. A sample FASTA file has been put into the Data folder for you to explore. 

#### Materials: 

[Grimoire](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-n7Rs0IK86-grimoire)

        Data/Sample1.fasta

```

#### Exercise: 

1. Ask Grimoire to explain what the FASTA file-format is, and how FASTA files are used.

2. Ask Grimoire to tell you the history of the FASTA format. (why?)

3. Ask Grimoire to list the preferred file-extensions for FASTA-format files, and explain what type of sequence-data each preferred extension is used for.

4(Suggestion). Pick one of the sequence-data types that appeals to you. Ask Grimoire to show you what data inside a file of that type would look like. Then pick another and do the same. Notice the differences between the data. 
    Ask Grimoire what situation or use case would need both types of data

4(Suggestion). Pick one of the sequnence-data types that appeals to you.  Ask Grimoire what a scientist could learn from that type of data. 

4(Suggestion). Come up with some sample sequence of data that you think fits one of the extension types. Send Grimoire your own sample data and ask it to fix it according to each of the file extensions and how it would look different.

# NOTES:
    We should have one of each file type for students to explore here. 
    Students should give Grimoire a file type. Can we identify the proper extension?
    This lesson can be dry for those who are less interested in history
    Need a solution or a self check so that students know they got the skill they need from this lesson
