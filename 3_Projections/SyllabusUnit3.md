## Projections
3.1 Sample Set Creation 
    * Create a sample report of hammers that lists every repgen genome inside of a sample.
    * Give an uneven set of samples. Determine the difference between good and bad data
3.2 Data Curation
    * Create the universal table and template for the data - helps with training data too
    * Create the x-matrix
    * Tune the x-matrix on presence vs absence or population, talk about expected output vs actual output
3.3 Machine Learning Classifier
    * Run the classifier and interpret the data
    * Create sample data that produces the expected outcome - creates parameters for successful classification
