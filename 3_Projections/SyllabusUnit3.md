## Projections

## 3.1 Sample Set Creation 

### Sample Set-1 Hammer Classification
    * Create a sample report of hammers that lists every repgen genome inside of a sample.
    
## 3.2 Data Curation

### Data Curation-1 Hammer Cut off Point
What is the cut off for how many hammers are needed to classify the genome?

### Data Curation-2 Scaled Cut off Point
Scale the cut off to the size of the sample file

### Data Curation-3 Sanity Check
Try your cut off point on another sample and determine if your cut off is correct

### Data Curation-4 Complete Sample Set
Use the updated hammer profile to classify the samples inside the sample set.
    
## 3.3 Creating the xmatrix   

### XMatrix-1 Universal Template
Create the universal table and template for the data with the columns pre populated.

### XMatrix-2 Populate Data by Presence
Create the x-matrix on presence or absense of a genome inside the sample

### XMatrix-3 Scaled for Population
Create a second x-matrix that is scaled on population

## 3.4 Machine Learning Classifier

### ML Classifier-1 Run the Classifier
Learn how to run the classifier and interpret the data that comes out of it.

### ML Classifier-2 Presence VS Population
Run classifier on the population xmatrix instead of the presence and absence version and see which one works better.

### ML Classifier-3 Parameters
Play with the parameters of the machine learning algorithm and see how the accuracy changes
