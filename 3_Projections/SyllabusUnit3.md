## Projections

## 3.1 Sample Set Creation 

### Sample Set-1 Gather Data
Gather the data for the samples you will be using for this exercise.

### Sample Set-2 Sorting Data
Sort the data into healthy and diseased samples.

### Sample Set-3 Finding Publications
Find the publications that have the SRA IDs of samples you can use.

### Sample Set-3 Hammer Report

## 3.2 Creating the xmatrix   

### XMatrix-1 Universal Template
Create the table of data with the feature set and target variable explicitly defined.

## 3.3 Machine Learning Classifier

### ML Classifier-1 Run the Classifier
Learn how to run the classifier and interpret the data that comes out of it.

### ML Classifier-2 Presence VS Population
Run classifier on the population xmatrix instead of the presence and absence version and see which one works better.

### ML Classifier-3 Parameters
Play with the parameters of the machine learning algorithm and see how the accuracy changes
