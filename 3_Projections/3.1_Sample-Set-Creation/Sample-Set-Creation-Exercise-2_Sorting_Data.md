## Exercise

1. Ask Grimoire to describe the different types of machine learning models that can be used to predict the presence of a disease. Specifically mention classification, random forest, and sample set creation.

# TODO
Separate into control and diseased groups
    Tag samples from the metadata 
    Also could be in the name when doing the search
    Look inside PRJDB9292(BioProject) • DRP008133(SRA Study) • All experiments • All runs( This is what we want)
        MetaData button in here - Consistent data for most projects
        Side Note: They all get the same name when doanloaded. Rename them ASAP so that you don't lose your data from ambiguous names.
        Mention word wrap in the view menu and rainbow CSV extension 
Roughly 1 GB per 10 samples (Have students check their space on their computer)
Need minimum of 100 samples, 50 from each group. (Can we do this from one paper?)
