#### Tab Separated Value Files Exercise 1.5 - Python Datatypes

Objective: Recognize Python Datatypes

Python is a programming language that lends itself to the large consumption of data. In this exercise, we will explore the different types of data python uses within its code. Most of these data types are common among all programming languages but a few are unique to Python itself. 

The program "data_types.py" has been created to help you explore these data types while also practicing the use of the command line. Before you begin, ensure that you have a Terminal window open of the GitBash profile. If you are unsure of how to find this setting, please refer to the "Download Instructions" around Git to make it a default setting for VSCode.
