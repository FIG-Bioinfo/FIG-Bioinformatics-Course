# Kmer Exercise 4 - Protein vs DNA Kmers

Objectives:
1. Understand how the Jaccard-similarity computed using a DNA-sequence's protein translation correlates with the Jaccard-similarity computed using the DNA itself

2. Get a better feel for the tradeoffs between "sensitivity" and "specificity"

## Exercises

1. Attach the `Definitions.html` file as in previous exercises, again using the prompt:
    ```
    I am going to give you some definitions in an attached file; you don't need to respond to them, just learn them. I'm then going to ask you some questions.
