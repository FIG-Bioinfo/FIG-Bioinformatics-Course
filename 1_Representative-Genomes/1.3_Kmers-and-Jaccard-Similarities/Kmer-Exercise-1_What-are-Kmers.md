# Kmer Exercise 1 - What are Kmers?

Objective: Learn about the concept of "Kmers" in sequences.

A DNA sequence is a sequence composed from the 4-character "alphabet" {a,c,g,t}. Each character is an abbreviation for one of the "nucleic acids" that are the subunits of a DNA molecule: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine. These characters are also called "bases" by biologists (short for "nucleobases"). The four "bases" form pairs, Adenine with Thymine and Cytosine with Guanine, and each pair forms a "rung" on the twisting double-helix "ladder" of a DNA strand --
see [this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#/media/File:DNA_chemical_structure.svg),
[this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#/media/File:DNA_Structure+Key+Labelled.pn_NoBB.png)
and [this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#/media/File:DNA_animation.gif).
Since in DNA, Adenine always pairs with Thymine and Cytosine always pairs with Guanine, it is sufficient to only list one of the two strands in the "double-helix", since given one strand, the other (or "complementary") strand can be trivially determined via base-pairing.

Depending on the organism, the DNA sequences composing its genome can be quite long; a virus will typically have a genome of between a thousand and 100 thousand base-pairs, a bacterium or archaeum will have a genome of between several hundred thousand to several million base-pairs, and a large multicellular organism such as a mouse or a human will have a genome containing billions of base-pairs.

Proteins are also represented by sequences of characters, but they instead use a 20-character "alphabet", with each of the 20 characters standing for an "amino acid" instead of a "nucleic acid".

In order to make searching for patterns in DNA or proteins more manageable, bioinformaticians will often break up long sequences into a set of short sequences called "Kmers". A "Kmer" is a sequence or string of length "K"; for example, `atgcgt` would be an example of a DNA "6-mer". 

In this course, we will often be working with DNA 20-mers and protein 8-mers.
* Review-question: Remember when we did FASTA files? Can you remember which file-extensions were commonly used for DNA vs Proteins?

Kmers have many uses in bioinformatics; not only can they be used to simplify searching for patterns in DNA or protein sequences, but they can be used to quickly identify sequences and to define a measure of "similarity" between two sequences. In this lesson, we will explore how bioinformaticians construct a set of Kmers from a sequence, and examine some of their basic use-cases.

## Exercises:

*ALWAYS RESET YOUR PATH* 

Type `cd $COURSE_DIR` into your command line to reset your path to the Course directory before starting each exercise.

Exercise Setup -- Please enter the following into Grimoire's "Message Grimoire" box:
  ```
    I am going to give you some definitions in an attached file;
    you don't need to respond to them, just learn them.
    I'm then going to ask you some questions.
  ```
Then click on the "Paperclip" icon and select the file `Definitions.html`, and hit the "Send Message" icon (the "Up-arrow" icon at the right of the "Message Grimoire" box). Grimoire should respond to your entering the above with something like "Understood" or "Got it". `Definitions.html` contains a list of definitions of terms and concepts specific to this course. We will be using the preceding method to "pre-prompt" Grimoire regarding the "context" for a set of exercises throughout the remainder of this course; you are welcome to look at the file `Definitions.html`, but some of the terms, definitions, and concepts may not make sense in advance of the exercise they are relevant to.

The following questions should be entered as individual prompts (or as Grimore puts them, "Messages"), but should be entered during the same session in which you uploaded the above definitions, since Grimoire will need these definitions to establish its "context", and it cannot remember the contents of one session in a different session, but will instead fall back on its "default" definitions unless "re-prompted".

1. Ask Grimoire "What is a Kmer, and how are Kmers used in bioinformatics?"

2. Ask "How can I know how many Kmers are in a given sequence?"
    * (Grimoire should answer with an explanation or formula that calculates the number of Kmers given the length of the sequence and `K`)

3. "Let 'cttgtatagtattgtcttgtgtatc' be a DNA sequence; please tell me the length of this sequence, and then list all of the 20-mers within this sequence."
    * NOTE: Do please check how many characters are in Grimoire's answers, because it will sometimes miscount the number of characters in a sequence -- e.g., it may get the length of the sequence wrong, or return a list of "19-mers" instead of "20-mers". Grimoire is not perfect! But it's pretty good at what it does do well, which is write code and explain concepts. If Grimoire miscounts the length of the entire sequence (which in this case should be '25') or the length of the Kmer, ask it "Are you sure about those lengths?" and it will usually correct its error.

4. "Is the Kmer 'atagctcga' within the sequence 'cttgtatagtattgtcttgtgtatc'?"

5. "Is the Kmer 'agtattgtc' within the sequence 'cttgtatagtattgtcttgtgtatc'?"

6. Ask Grimoire to write a program named `extract_kmers_from_fasta.py` that satisfies the following specifications:

  * Mandatory Kmer-length command-line argument short-form `-K`, long-form `--Kmer`, which must have an integer value.

  * Optional command-line argument short-form `-t`, long-form `--type`, whose values may either be `dna` or `protein`. Default type should be `dna`.

  * If invoked with an argument `-h` or `--help`, the program should print a "help" message to STDERR describing the program, listing the argument names, showing whether an argument is mandatory or optional, and indicating that the data-file will be read from STDIN. The program  should then exit.

  * The program shall read a FASTA-formated file from STDIN; you are allowed to use BioPython to read, write, and operate on sequences.

  * if the `--type` argument is specified, then if `--type` is `dna` the sequence should be converted to lower-case, else if `--type` is protein the sequence should be converted to upper-case.

  * For each sequence, the program should extract all possible Kmers of length given by the Kmer-length argument, and write to STDOUT a two-column tab-separated file consisting of the Kmer and the sequence-ID that it came from .

  * If the `--type` argument is specified, then the Kmer should be checked before output for whether it contains characters that are not in the DNA or Protein alphabets, respectively, and invalid Kmers and the sequence-id they came from should be written to STDERR instead of STDOUT.

  * On exit the program should report to STDERR the number of sequences read, the number of Kmers written to STDOUT, and the number of invalid Kmers found.

Use VScode to save `extract_kmers_from_fasta.py` in the `Code/` subdirectory.

7. Run `extract_kmers_from_fasta.py` on the following files, which will be found in subdirectory `Data/`. These files are all small, so you should be able to figure out what the output should be in your head. Each of the files will contain one "bad" sequence, i.e., a sequence that contains invalid characters for that file-type.

* good-bad_dna.fna
* good-bad_proteins.faa

Experiment with different values for `-K`. Then, see how the output changes  when you specify the `--type` argument.
* BONUS: What do you think will happen if you use the 'dna' type for the protein file, or the 'protein' type for the DNA file? Try it, and see if you have guessed correctly.

7. Run `extract_kmers_from_fasta.py` on the following files, which will be found in subdirectory `Data/`.
  * good-bad_dna.fna
  * good-bad_proteins.faa

These files are pretty small and should be easy to see what the kmers will be. If you are not sure, you can run the program with the `-K` argument set to a small value, such as 2 or 3. Below is an example of a command that you can use to run the program with `-K` set to 20 just like the hammers will be:

```
python3 Code/extract_kmers_from_fasta.py -K 20 -t dna < Data/good-bad_dna.fna
```
The output will include a list of Kmers and the sequence-ID that they came from. This is a great starting point for creating files to see what the data structure of your sequence data is. If you output to the terminal for the above command, the printout of the output should be the following: 

```

Sequences read: 3
Kmers written to STDOUT: 22
Invalid Kmers found: 11
```
8. Remember that you can alrways redirect the output of the program to a file.  You can do this by adding `> Data/output.txt` to the end of the command. Be careful to not use the same output file name twice, as this will overwrite the previous file and you will lose your previous work. 

```
python3 Code/extract_kmers_from_fasta.py -K 20 -t dna < Data/good-bad_dna.fna > Data/dna_kmers_output.tsv
```
Find the example output of the above command in the `1_Representative-Genomes/1.3_Kmers-and-Jaccard-Similarities/Solutions` subdirectory. See if your output file is the same as the example output file. No matter what, the following data should still be printed to the terminal:

```
Sequences read: 3
Kmers written to STDOUT: 22
Invalid Kmers found: 11
```

9. Run the same command for the protein file. Use the `-K` argument to set the Kmer length to 20.

```
python3 Code/extract_kmers_from_fasta.py -K 20 -t protein < Data/good-bad_proteins.faa > Data/protein_kmers_output.tsv
```
Find the example output of the above command in the `1_Representative-Genomes/1.3_Kmers-and-Jaccard-Similarities/Solutions` subdirectory. Regardless of the output file's success, the following data should still be printed to the terminal:

```
Sequences read: 3
Kmers written to STDOUT: 2
Invalid Kmers found: 1
```s

## Solution Check instructions:

The `Solutions` subdirectory for this module contains two files:
* A document `Kmer-Exercise-1_Solutions.md` containing explicit answers to each of the problems in this set of exercises, which you should read carefully,

* A program `extract_kmers_from_fasta_solution.py` that was generated by the prompt within this exercise. Your own solution-program may differ in small details from the provided solution-program, but both programs should generate the same output. Please run the solution-program on the test-files, and use the `diff` command to compare your program's output to the solution-program's output.
As a reminder, the `diff` command has the following syntax:

```
diff file1 file2
```
where `file1` and `file2` are the names of the two files being compared.
If there are no differences between the two files, then the `diff` command will produce no output. No output is good in this case! :-)
