Hammer Terminology Definitions: Strength, Precision, Worth, Hits
================================================================

STRENGTH is a measure of how much weight we assign to a hit by the hammer.
Currently, it is based on the repgen/role combination.  If the combination
has few hammers, the strength is high.  If the combination has lots of
hammers, the strength is low.  This keeps changing as we come up with new
ideas for getting better results.

PRECISION and WORTH are based on the number of neighbor and distant genomes
hit by the hammer in features annotated with its role.  WORTH is the percent
of neighbor genomes with the hammer, and PRECISION is the percent of foreign
genomes without the hammer.  This measurement is done across all occurrences
of the role in the good-genome list.  A precision of 1.0 means no occurrence
of the role outside the neighborhood has a hammer hit.  We require high
precision but do not require high worth.

HITS is the number of times the hammer was found in neighbor genome
occurrences of the role.

All of these are computed in the initial pass, when the hammer finder looks
at FASTA files containing all occurrences of each role in the BV-BRC
good-genome list.
