# Hammers

Hammers are "Genetic Barcodes" that we can use to try and create targeted antibiotics or as a faster way to classify and annotate genomes. In this module, the goal is to create a set of hammers that can be used to quickly identify genomes and use that data to project possible diseases in a human metagenomic sample.

## 2.1 Hammers as "Genetic Barcodes"

### Genetic Barcodes-1 Why do we need hammers and what are they?
Discover the purpose of having a hammer as a classification tool for unknown genomes

### Genetic Barcodes-2 New Genome
Take a new genome and use your new hammer tool to attempt to identify the mystery genome.

### Genetic Barcodes-3 Using the Hammers
Compare your new genome to multiple representative genomes at once to attempt to identify the genome

## 2.2 Hammer Tuning

### Hammer Tuning-1 Precision
Make sure the hammer doesn't occur in other representative genomes

### Hammer Tuning-2 Accuracy
Picking the correct roles mean that the hammers are more accurate for your purpose.  

### Hammer Tuning-3 Worthiness
How many peer genomes that are represented are hit by the hammer you choose?
** Hitting a wide area is good for classification - lots of hits means lots of peers are hit which is good for classifying a genome
** Hitting a small area is good for antibiotics - few hits means less collateral damage from the antibiotic in your system

## 2.3 Creation of the Hammer Set

### Creation-1 Create a hammer set
Create a set for all available repgen genomes to use for both classification, and antibiotics

### Creation-2 Use Case: Classification
Use the hammer set to classify genomes inside of a sample.

### Creation-3 Use Case: Antibiotics
Use the hammer set to target a group for antibiotics

### Creation-4 Use Case: Closest Genome
Use the hammer set to find the genome closest to the mystery genome
