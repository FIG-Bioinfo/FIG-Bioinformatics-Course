# Hammers as Genetic Barcodes Exercise 3 - Using the Hammer Set

Objective: 



## Materials

TODO insert a sample data here with planted genomes in it. -  MysteryGenome.fasta
TODO have a sample representative genome sample for creating hammers. - Rep10.list.tbl, Rep10.seqs.tbl, genomeid.fasta
TODO program that will grab 20-mers without killing the memory in most machines

## Exercises

1. 

    * Problem: We have a new genome and we need to find his closest representative
    * Find PheS and compare it to all the other PheS - Problem comes in if our genome is not annotated (takes a lot of time)
    * Take a single repgen, is our genome close to this one?
    *We need to look for a "hammer" which is a genetic bar code. This occurs in the PheS but nowhere else in the genome. If we find this hammer, then we know we have a PheS like our original one.
    * We find these hammers and see how many are in the new one - We don't really know what this number means
    *Grab a couple other genomes and see how many hammers hit. We should grab some that we know are close and some that we know are far.
