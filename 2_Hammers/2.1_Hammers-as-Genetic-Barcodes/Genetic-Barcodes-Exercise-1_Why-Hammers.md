# Hammers as Genetic Barcodes Exercise 1 - Why do we need hammers and what are they?

Objective: Define and Describe the idea behind the "Genetic Barcode" that we call a "Hammer".

At the end of the last unit, you were able to successfully create a "Representative Genome Set" or "RepGenSet". A "RepGenSet" provides you with a broad overview of your "Universe of Genomes". Suppose that you wanted to add a new genome to your Universe. How would you know which genome is the new genome's nearest representative? How would you find it? This is where the idea of a "Genetic Barcode" comes in. 

You are probably familiar with the use of "barcodes" to identify a product or to encode a device's serial-number. In bioinformatics, we use readily identifiable sequences of DNA to serve as a "barcode" for a genome.

## Exercises

1. Ask Grimoire to tell you what is meant by a "Genetic Barcode", with particular emphasis to which sequences provide a good barcode for Bacteria and Archaea. (NOTE: If Grimoire uses any terms that you are not familiar with, you can ask it to explain these terms to you.)

2. Ask Grimoire what properties and characteristics make a sequence a good "genetic barcode".

3. In exercise (1.) Grimoire most likely cited the "16S Ribosomal RNA" as its example for Bacteria and Archaea. Ask it whether protein-encoding genes can also serve as "barcodes" for Bacteria and Archaea.

4. Ask Grimoire which properties or characteristics of a protein-encoding gene would make that gene a good "genetic barcode", if it has not already done so.

5. In this course, we will be particularly interested in a type of "genetic barcode" that we call a "Hammer". "Hammers" are defined as 20-character DNA sequences that satisfy the following properties:

    * They occur exactly once in exactly one genome that is a member of one of the sets of special genomes that we are calling "Representative Genomes" ("RepGen Set" for short).

    * They are found within a particular class of genes that encode what we call "Singly-Occuring Universal Roles" ("SOURs" for short). A SOUR is characterized as follows:

        *  It is "Singly Occurring", which means that a genome contains exactly one copy of a gene that implements this function.

        * It serves a "Universal Role", that is, it can be expected to occur within every genome.

6. SOURs are often part of the "Central Machinery" of a cell. Ask Grimoire to tell you what is meant by "Central Machinery of a Cell", with particular emphasis on Bacteria and Archaea.

The observation of a "Hammer" within a genome serves as strong evidence that it is closely related to the Representative genome from which that hammer was derived. The more hammers from a given representative that a genome contains, the more likely it is that that genome is closely related to that representative.
