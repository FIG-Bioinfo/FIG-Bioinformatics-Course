# Hammers as Genetic Barcodes Exercise 1 - Why do we need hammers and what are they?

Objective: Define and Describe the idea behind the Genetic Barcode and the Hammer

At the end of the last unit, you were able to successfully create a representative genome set. This gives you an overall view of what the entire genome space is for your set of genomes. Say you wanted to add a genome to that set. Would you know which genome is their representative? How would you find it? This is where the idea of a "Genetic Barcode" comes in. 

You are probably familiar with the use of "barcodes" to identify a product or to encode a device's serial-number. In bioinformatics, we use readily identifiable sequences of DNA to serve as a "barcode" for a genome.

## Materials

## Exercises

1. Ask Grimoire to tell you what is meant by a "Genetic Barcode".

2. Ask Grimoire what properties and characteristics make a sequence a good "genetic barcode".

3. In exercise (1.), Grimoire probably gave you examples of "barcodes" that are more relevant to plants or animals. If so, ask it what would serve as a "barcode" for Bacteria.

4. In exercise (3.) Grimoire most likely gave you the "16S Ribosomal RNA" as its example for Bacteria. Ask it whether protein-encoding genes can also serve as "barcodes".

5. Ask Grimoire which properties or characteristics of a protein-encoding gene would make that gene a good "genetic barcode".

6. In this course, we will be particularly interested in a type of "genetic barcode" that we call a "Hammer". "Hammers" are defined as 20-character DNA sequences that satisfy the following properties:

    * They occur exactly once in exactly one genome that is a member of a set of special genomes that we will call "Representative Genomes" ("RepGen Set" for short).

    * They are found within a particular class of genes that encode what we call "Singly-Occuring Universal Roles" ("SOURs" for short). A SOUR is characterized as follows:
        *  It is "Singly Occurring", which means that a genome contains exactly one copy of a gene that implements this function.
        * It serves a "Universal Role", that is it can be expected to occur within every genome.

7. SOURs are often (although not always) part of the "Central Machinery" of a cell. Ask Grimoire to tell you what is meant by "Central Machinery of a Cell".

The observation of a "Hammer" within a genome serves as strong evidence that it is closely related to the Representative genome from which that hammer was derived. The more hammers from a given representative that a genome contains, the more likely it is that that genome is closely related to that representative.
