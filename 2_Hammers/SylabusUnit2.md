## Hammers
1. Creation of the Hammer Set
    * Choose a single repgen genome and create hammers from a single role. Make sure none repeat
    * Role vs any sequence. Why do we use the Roles that we do. 
    * Show whether a random genome is part of the "neighborhood" using hammers
2. Hammer Worthiness
    * Hammers are only as worthy as the role they use. What do the hammers look like with a bad role?
    * Create hammers using more than one role
    * Account for translation errors - allow hammers to be a single character off
3. Classify a genome using the hammer set. Give multiple use cases
    * FASTA sample is given. What repgen genomes are present in the sample?
    * FASTQ sample is given. Modify the hammers to trash any low quality reads
