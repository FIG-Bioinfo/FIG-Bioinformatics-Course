# Introduction

This course is meant to give an introduction to AI-assisted code-development via the exploration of three major topics in applied bioinformatics. Each topic has been organized into a module consisting of a number of related subtopics and associated exercises. You will find the exercises inside each topic's folder, along with any data that you might need inside that topic's Data-folder, and related code inside that topics `Code/` folder. If you need any help or are not sure how to continue, you are encouraged to use AI tools to help you throughout your learning journey.
