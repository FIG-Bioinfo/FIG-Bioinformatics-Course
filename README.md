# Introduction

This course is meant to give an introduction to AI-assisted code-development via the exploration of three major topics in applied bioinformatics. Each topic has been organized into a module consisting of a number of related subtopics and associated exercises. You will find the exercises for each topic inside that topic's folder; any data that you might need for an exercise will be inside the course's `Data` folder, and related code inside the course's  `Code/` folder. If you need any help or are not sure how to continue, you are encouraged to ask questions of the `Grimoire` variant of the `ChatGPT` AI tool to help you throughout your learning journey.
